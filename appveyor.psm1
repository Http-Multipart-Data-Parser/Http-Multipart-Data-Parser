                # one detected and the previous versions are no longer detected as being installed.
                #
                # This whole thing is problematic because GitVersion.Tool 5.7 is not compatible with
                # .NET 6 (in fact, it doesn't even install) and you must have .NET 5 installed side-by-side
                # with .NET 6 in order to install and use GitVersion.Tool
                #
                # I spent a whole day trying to find a solution but ultimately the only reliable solution
                # I was able to come up with is to install in the default location (which is /usr/share/dotnet)
                # using 'sudo' because you need admin privileges to access the default install location.
                #
                # November 2022: I tried removing this workaround since GetVersion.Tool was updated more
                # than 2 years ago but it led to another problem: https://ci.appveyor.com/project/Jericho/zoomnet/builds/48579496/job/pymt60j9b53ayxta#L78
                #
                # Therefore this workaround seems like a permanent solution.
